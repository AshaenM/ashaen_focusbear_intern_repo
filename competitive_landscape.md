# Understand competitive landscape

## What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
Focus Bear combines blocking distractions with routine support and mental, physical check-ins for all users.

When comparing Focus Bear to Freedom, Focus Bear:

- Guides you through step-by-step routines (morning/evening) rather than just blocking distractions.

- Uses intention prompts when opening distracting apps, adding mindfulness rather than pure restriction.

- Includes automatic micro-breaks that adapt to your activity (e.g., skips if you’re on a video call).

- Designed specifically with neurodivergent (ADHD/ASD) users in mind, not just general productivity.

When comparing Focus Bear to Cold Turkey, Focus Bear:

- Offers “Cuddly Bear” mode for softer nudges, whereas Cold Turkey is only hardcore blocking.

- Integrates guided routines and habit formation, not just access restriction.

- Adds healthy breaks and focus sessions that balance productivity with rest, instead of only locking down apps/sites.

- Built to reduce decision fatigue, whereas Cold Turkey expects users to configure everything manually.

When comparing Focus Bear to Tiimo, Focus Bear:

- Combines visual scheduling with actual distraction blocking, something Tiimo doesn’t do.

- Provides intention-setting prompts to encourage conscious tech use, beyond just reminders.

- Includes real-time routine guidance (one habit at a time), while Tiimo focuses on planning and notifications.

- Integrates Pomodoro-style focus sessions and micro-breaks, which Tiimo lacks.

When comparing Focus Bear to Routinery, Focus Bear:

- Goes beyond routine planning by actively walking you through tasks step-by-step.

- Adds distraction blocking and intention prompts, whereas Routinery only structures routines.

- Features adaptive micro-breaks to prevent burnout, not just habit timers.

- Specifically designed to support executive function challenges (e.g., getting “unstuck”), unlike Routinery’s checklist approach.

I read these articles, blogs, user reviews, combined them with Chat GPT to understand the key differences between the software.

## If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
Focus Bear seems to be a more complete App as it is able to integrate my habits, tasks, routines, wellbeing all into one software so it helps me stay on track for the whole day rather than only when I want to manually start working on a certain task.

## What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
Focus Bear is mindful of my physical wellbeing too by reminding me to move around, drink water etc.

## Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?

A clear improvement Focus Bear could make is more customizable UI layouts for routines and focus sessions, especially since competitors approach this differently.

### Specific UI Changes to Consider
Adjustable routine view: Allow users to switch between a step-by-step mode (current default) and a condensed overview mode that shows all upcoming tasks at once.

Why? Some users—especially visual planners—benefit from seeing the full routine to anticipate transitions, similar to Tiimo’s timeline view.

Theme and contrast options: Offer light/dark themes and high-contrast modes, as Tiimo and Routinery both provide more visually adaptable interfaces.

Resizable widgets/panels: Let users adjust font size or tile sizes for better accessibility. Freedom and Cold Turkey keep things minimal, but they allow for flexible lists that scale to screen size.

Quick-access dashboard: A single screen combining today’s routine progress + next focus session would reduce context-switching, inspired by how Routinery shows “progress bars” for routines.

### How Competitors Handle This Differently
Tiimo: Uses highly visual timelines and customizable icons, which helps neurodivergent users quickly orient themselves.

Routinery: Allows grid and list views for routines, giving flexibility depending on preference.

Freedom & Cold Turkey: Minimal interfaces but consistent cross-device layout, which reduces learning friction.

### Why This Matters for Focus Bear
Focus Bear’s strength is guided execution, but its current UI leans toward a single interaction model (one-step-at-a-time). Adding view flexibility and accessibility controls could widen its appeal without compromising its neurodivergent-friendly design.
