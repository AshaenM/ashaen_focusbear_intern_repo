- Developers
  - Build and implement features
  - Collaborate with UX, QA, and PM to deliver working software
  - Estimate, plan, and break down tasks during sprint planning
- QA (Quality Assurance)
  - Test the product to catch bugs and ensure it meets requirements.
  - Write test cases and automate testing when possible.
  - Work closely with developers to maintain quality throughout the sprint.
- Product Manager (PM)
  - Owns the product vision and roadmap.
  - Prioritizes the backlog and makes decisions on what to build next.
  - Acts as the bridge between business needs, users, and the development team.
- Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)
  - Facilitates Agile ceremonies and removes blockers.
  - Supports the team in following Agile principles.
  - Helps improve team processes and ensures smooth collaboration.
- UX Designer
  - Researches user needs and designs intuitive, user-centered experiences.
  - Creates wireframes, prototypes, and collaborates with developers.
  - Validates designs through user testing and iteration.
- Stakeholders
  - Provide input on priorities and business goals.
  - Review progress and give feedback during demos or reviews.
- Customer Support
  - Shares user feedback and reports issues from real users.
  - Helps identify pain points and common usability concerns.
  - Collaborates with the team to improve the user experience.

## How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?
- Developers
  - Scrum - Commit to a set of tasks during Sprint Planning and deliver them by the end of the sprint.
  - Kanban - Pull tasks as capacity allows; work is continuous, not time-boxed.
- QA (Quality Assurance)
  - Scrum - Test completed work within each sprint to ensure it’s done before the sprint ends.
  - Kanban - Test tasks as they flow through the board; work with WIP limits to avoid bottlenecks
- Product Manager (PM)
  - Scrum - Prioritizes backlog before Sprint Planning; defines sprint goals.
  - Kanban -  Continuously prioritizes the backlog; can update priorities anytime since there are no fixed sprints.
- Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)
  - Scrum - Facilitates ceremonies (daily stand-ups, planning, retrospectives) and removes blockers.
  - Kanban - Focuses on improving flow, visualizing work, and helping enforce WIP limits—less ceremony-driven.
- UX Designer
  - Scrum - Plans design work into sprints; may work ahead to prepare designs for upcoming development
  - Kanban - Works on design tasks as needed; can flow alongside or slightly ahead of dev in a continuous stream.
- Stakeholders
  - Scrum - Review progress during Sprint Reviews/demos and give feedback on sprint outcomes.
  - Kanban - Provide feedback continuously; reviews happen more fluidly, often aligned with feature readiness.
- Customer Support
  - Scrum - Shares user feedback for planning future sprints; typically not involved during active sprints.
  - Kanban - Feeds real-time user issues directly into the backlog, allowing faster response.

## What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?
As an UX Designer, I contribute to the agile process by understanding user needs by researching, designing intiutive, user-centered interfaces, collaborating closely with product managers, developers, and QA, creating wireframes, prototypes, participating in agile ceremonies and iterating designs through user feedback.

## How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?
As an UX Designer, my responbilities overlap and interact with other roles in these ways:
- PM - Collaborate on understanding user needs and defining product requirements to ensure designs align with business goals.
- Developers - Work closely to communicate design intent, clarify functionality, and adjust designs based on technical constraints or feasibility.
- QA - Coordinate to ensure usability issues are tested and resolved, and help define acceptance criteria related to user experience.
- Agile PM - Participate in ceremonies to sync design progress with sprint goals and raise any blockers.
- Stakeholders- Present design concepts and user insights to gather feedback and align expectations.
- Customer Support - Use real user feedback from support teams to identify pain points and inform design improvements.

## Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.
As an UX designer, I ensure that user needs and experiences are at the heart of our product development. I collaborate with product managers, developers, and QA throughout the Agile process to create intuitive designs, provide user insights, and iterate based on feedback. By integrating user-centered design into each sprint, I help deliver products that are both functional and delightful.

## Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.
I will frequently collaborate with developers. To improve teamwork with them, I can:

- Communicate designs clearly and early, providing detailed specs and interactive prototypes.
- Be open to technical feedback and work together to find practical solutions.
- Participate in daily stand-ups and sprint planning to stay aligned on priorities and timelines.
- Respond quickly to questions or blockers to keep development moving smoothly.
