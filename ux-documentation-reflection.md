# Learn How to Use Google Docs for UX Documentation

## What types of UX documentation are typically created in Google Docs?
- User research summaries
- Personas
- User journey maps
- Meeting notes
- Usability testing plans
- Design rationales
- Design handoff notes

## How should design decisions and rationale be documented for future reference?
- Use a shared document or platform like Google docs, Notion etc.
- Clearly state the problem, solution, and why the decision was made.
- Include user research findings, or feedback that informed the decision.
- Add visuals like screenshots or diagrams that help visualise the context.
- Keep it organised with version control for easy future access and to be able to go back to previous versions for some reason.

## What is the best way to structure user research findings to make them easy to read?
User research findings can be structured into a report that has sections containing information regarding
- introduction
- research goals
- business value
- methodology
- key learnings
- recommendation

A valuable resource I found that gives a comprehensive overview of a good UX research report can be presented:

## How can UX documentation be used to support accessibility and inclusive design?
- Include accessibility requirements like colour contrast and keyboard navigation in the design specifications.
- Document user needs from diverse backgrounds, including neurodivergent individuals.
- Share inclusive design principles like simple language with flexible layouts.
- Use research findings to highlight barriers faced by neurodivergent users.
- Keep notes on feedback from users with disabilities to inform future design decisions.

## If you conducted a user testing session, how would you document the results?
I would have a separate document for this session with the following details:
- Title & Date
- Goals
- Participants
- Tasks
- Observations
- Successes and issues
- Insights
- Recommendations
- Next steps

## How can a well-structured UX document help prevent miscommunication between teams?
- It provides a single document of reliable facts everyone can refer to.
- It clearly outlines the design rationale, goals, and user needs.
- It reduces assumptions made by one by documenting decisions and feedback.
- It keeps all teams aligned on priorities and expectations.
- It helps new team members quickly get up to date.

## What challenges might arise when writing UX documentation, and how can you avoid them?
- Lack of clarity
  - Use simple language with bullet points
- Too much or too little details
  - Focus on key insights, add links for more information
- Outdated content
  - Set reminders to ensure documents are up to date.
- Poor organization
  - Use clear headings, templates when possible and good structure
- Limited team engagement
  - Share documents early, ask for feedback, and involve others whenever possible.
