# Creating a Clickable Prototype in Figma

## What is the difference between a static wireframe and an interactive prototype?

Static Wireframe
- Non-interactive: Just a set of fixed images or sketches showing layout and structure.

- Focus: Visualizing content placement, hierarchy, and basic page elements.

- Use: Early-stage planning, communicating design concepts, and gathering feedback on layout.

- Example: A grayscale sketch showing where buttons, text, and images go, but you can’t click or navigate.

Interactive Prototype
- Interactive: Simulates user interactions like clicking buttons, navigating between screens, or filling forms.

- Focus: Testing user flows, navigation, and overall experience.

- Use: Usability testing, stakeholder demos, and refining the design before development.

- Example: A clickable mockup where users can go through tasks as if using the real product.

## How does prototyping help validate usability before development?

- Simulates real user interactions: Prototypes allow users to click, navigate, and complete tasks, closely mimicking the final experience.

- Identifies usability issues early: Testing a prototype reveals navigation problems, confusing workflows, or missing features before costly coding begins.

- Validates user flows: Prototyping checks if users can accomplish their goals efficiently and intuitively.

- Gathers actionable feedback: Observing users interact with the prototype helps designers understand pain points and areas for improvement.

- Reduces development risks: Early validation lowers the chance of building features that don’t meet user needs or cause frustration.

- Supports iterative design: Prototypes can be quickly adjusted based on feedback, refining usability continuously.

## What are the key features of Figma’s prototyping tools?

- Interactive hotspots: Create clickable areas on frames to simulate navigation and user interactions.

- Transitions and animations: Add smooth animated transitions between screens (e.g., slide, dissolve, smart animate).

- Device frames and scrolling: Preview prototypes in device frames and simulate vertical/horizontal scrolling.

- Overlays and modals: Design pop-ups or dropdowns that appear over the main screen.

- Interactive components: Use components that can change state (e.g., toggles, buttons) within prototypes.

- Linking between frames: Easily connect different screens to build user flows.

- Preview and sharing: View prototypes live in the browser or share a link with stakeholders for feedback.

- User flow mapping: Visualize and organize navigation paths within the design file.

## How do designers use prototypes for usability testing and stakeholder feedback?

Usability Testing
- Simulate user tasks: Prototypes let testers interact with the design by clicking buttons, navigating screens, and completing workflows—mimicking real product use.

- Observe behavior: Designers watch how users navigate, where they struggle, and which parts cause confusion or errors.

- Gather qualitative feedback: Test participants share their thoughts on ease of use, clarity, and overall experience.

- Identify pain points early: Usability issues can be detected and addressed before costly development.

- Test different versions: Prototypes allow quick iteration and A/B testing of design alternatives based on user responses.

Stakeholder Feedback
- Visualize concepts: Prototypes provide a tangible, interactive representation of the product vision beyond static images or descriptions.

- Demonstrate user flows: Stakeholders can experience how users will move through the product, making it easier to understand features and functionality.

- Facilitate clear communication: Interactive prototypes reduce misunderstandings and align expectations across teams.

- Incorporate suggestions: Stakeholders can give precise, informed feedback that designers can quickly incorporate into the prototype.

- Build confidence: Seeing and interacting with a prototype helps stakeholders approve designs and support next steps.

## What usability issues can a clickable prototype reveal that a static wireframe cannot?

- Navigation problems: Whether users can easily move between screens or get stuck in loops.

- Interactive element clarity: If buttons, links, or controls are obvious and behave as expected.

- User flow efficiency: How smoothly users complete tasks and whether steps are intuitive or confusing.

- Feedback and states: How well the interface communicates changes (e.g., button pressed, loading states, error messages).

- Discoverability of features: Whether users notice and understand interactive elements or hidden menus.

- Timing and pacing: Whether transitions or animations impact user understanding or cause frustration.

- Error handling: How users recover from mistakes or invalid inputs.

- Responsiveness: How the interface reacts to different inputs or screen sizes (if the prototype supports this).

## How can prototyping help designers communicate ideas more clearly to developers?

- Demonstrates functionality: Instead of describing interactions in words, prototypes show exactly how buttons, menus, and workflows work.

- Clarifies user flows: Developers can see the sequence of screens and how users move through the app, reducing misunderstandings.

- Highlights edge cases: Prototypes can include states like errors, loading screens, or empty states that need to be handled.

- Shows animations and transitions: Helps developers understand timing and behavior that are hard to explain with static specs.

- Provides a shared reference: Serves as a single source of truth that both designers and developers can refer to throughout development.

- Speeds up feedback loops: Developers can test interactions early and ask questions before coding starts.

- Reduces assumptions: Minimizes guesswork about intended design details and user experience.

## What are common mistakes designers make when creating prototypes?

- Overcomplicating early prototypes: Adding too much detail or interaction too soon, which can slow down iteration and obscure core usability issues.

- Ignoring user goals: Focusing on flashy features instead of testing real user tasks and flows.

- Skipping key interactions: Leaving out important buttons, navigation, or error states that affect usability.

- Not testing with real users: Failing to validate the prototype with actual users, relying only on internal feedback.

- Using unrealistic content: Placeholder text or images that don’t reflect real scenarios, which can confuse testers.

- Neglecting accessibility: Overlooking keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, or color contrast.

- Not updating prototypes after feedback: Treating prototypes as static rather than evolving them based on user and stakeholder input.

- Poor organization: Having messy or unlinked screens that make the prototype hard to navigate.

- Relying solely on prototypes: Forgetting to supplement with documentation or annotations for developers.
