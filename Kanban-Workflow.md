# Agile Workflows & Kanban

## How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?
It is a visual tool that helps manage and track work in progress.  It helps visualise the workflow, track progress, limit multitasking, highlight bottlenecks and supports async work.

## What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent?
- Backlog - Tasks that are planned but not yet started
- In progress - Tasks that are currrently being worked on 
- Blocked - Tasks that can't move forward due to an issue
- Done - Tasks that have been completed

## How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?
Tasks are moved from left to right through the columns as they progress and each team member is responsible for updating their own tasks.

## What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?
- Improves focus
- Improves quality
- Reduces bottlenecks
- Enhances collaboration

## How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
- Visualises workload
- Limits WIP
- Focuses on flow
- Makes priorities clear

## How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
- I can visualise my workflow to improve it
- I can manage the flow of tasks making my work more efficient
- I can improve continously by adjusting my process based on what's working and not.

## Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.
I can use a Kanban board to break design work into smaller, clearly labeled tasks.
