# Introduction to UX Research Methods

## What are the two main types of UX research? 
- Qualitative: Focuses on behaviors, motivations, and experiences
- Quantitative: Focuses on numbers and metrics

## What are common UX research methods?
- User Interviews – Gather in-depth insights about user needs, motivations, and pain points
- Usability Testing – Observe users as they interact with a product to identify usability issues
- Surveys – Collect large-scale feedback on user opinions, behaviors, or satisfaction
- A/B Testing – Compare two versions of a design to see which performs better
- Analytics Review – Analyze user behavior data (e.g., click rates, bounce rates)
- Card Sorting – Understand how users categorize information for better IA (information architecture)
- Field Studies / Observation – Watch users in their natural environment for contextual insights
- Diary Studies – Track user behavior or experience over time through self-reported logs

## When should you use observational research vs. self-reported feedback?
Use observational research when:

- You want to see how users actually behave (not just what they say they do)
- You're testing usability or task completion in real time
- Users may not be aware of their habits or struggles

Use self-reported feedback when:

- You want to understand user perceptions, preferences, or emotions
- You're gathering opinions, satisfaction levels, or motivations
- You can't observe users directly (e.g., remote users, early-stage research)

## What are the benefits and limitations of remote vs. in-person UX research?
Remote UX Research
- Benefits
  - Wider reach: Access to diverse participants across locations
  - Cost-effective: No travel or room booking costs
  - Natural environment: Users behave more realistically in their own space
  - Flexible scheduling: Easier to fit into participants’ lives

- Limitations
  - Tech issues: Connectivity or device problems can disrupt sessions
  - Harder to observe body language: Miss subtle cues or distractions
  - Less control: Can’t guide participants as easily or manage environment

In-person UX Research
- Benefits
  - Full context: Observe facial expressions, posture, hesitation
  - Easier facilitation: Help participants in real time if needed
  - Rich insights: Deeper engagement and clearer communication

- Limitations
  - More expensive: Travel, venue, and setup costs
  - Limited reach: Geographically restricted pool
  - Scheduling challenges: Harder to coordinate logistics

## If Focus Bear wanted to improve its onboarding experience, which UX research methods would be most useful?
- User Interviews
  - Understand first impressions, confusion points, and user expectations
  - Learn about emotional reactions during onboarding

- Usability Testing
  - Observe users going through onboarding in real-time
  - Identify where they struggle, skip steps, or drop off

- Survey
  - Collect quantitative feedback on satisfaction and clarity
  - Ask about users' goals and whether onboarding met them

## What challenges might arise when collecting self-reported user feedback?
- Memory Bias:
Users may forget specific details or misremember their experience.

- Social Desirability Bias:
Users might give answers they think you want to hear, not how they truly feel.

- Vague Responses:
Feedback like "It’s confusing" or "I don’t like it" lacks actionable detail.

- Subjectivity:
Self-reported feedback often reflects personal preference, not universal usability issues.

- Mismatch with Observed Behavior:
What users say vs. what they do can differ dramatically.

- Limited Expression:
Some users struggle to articulate problems clearly, especially with complex interfaces.

## How can UX designers avoid bias when conducting research?
- Ask Neutral Questions:
Avoid leading language (e.g., “How easy was that?”, “How did that go?”).

- Observe, Don’t Interpret (Too Soon):
Focus on what users do, not what you think they meant.

- Don’t Explain the Interface:
Let users explore naturally; resist the urge to guide or help.

- Use Consistent Interview Scripts:
Ask every participant the same core questions to reduce inconsistency.

- Diverse Participants:
Include users with varied backgrounds to avoid one-sided perspectives.

- Pilot Your Research:
Test your method/questions on a few people first to catch unintentional bias.

- Document Objectively:
Separate observations (what happened) from interpretations (why it happened).

- Be Aware of Confirmation Bias:
Stay open to feedback that challenges your assumptions or design preferences.
