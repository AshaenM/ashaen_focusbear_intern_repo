## Identify at least one habit or practice you can adopt to improve data security in your role.
I can minimize and anonymize user data in prototypes and design files. I can avoid using real user data (emails, names, payment info) in Figma. I can use fake data (like “User A”, “test@example.com”) when showcasing user flows or mockups. This prevents accidental leaks during design reviews, sharing files, or uploading to public portfolios.

## Document at least one key learning or security measure you will implement.
I will ensure all my work related accounts have strong unique passwords with a password manager and 2FA.
