## Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?
Yes, during last semester's group project, we had a demonstration with our client and supervisor regarding our progress during one of our sprints. To prepare for it, we had to collaboratively create a presentation and prepare for it. To this we each split up different sections of the presentation between ourselves and set a deadline. Everyone respected it by doing their parts on time. The person in charge of finalising everything had enought time to then fix everything up. We then decided on a day to meet up physically and practice delivering it. Everyone showed up on time and stayed focused throughout our meeting without wasting too much time. The fact that everyone was respectful of each others' time and work made it very effective and professional.

## How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?
I will give the person 2-3 business days to get back to me. If they dont by then, I will send a follow up email. If possible, I will also send a message on their Discord or message telling them to kindly check their email. If there is no response even after then, I would politely loop in the manager and seek their advice especially if a deadline is at risk or if my work is getting blocked.
