# Handling Design Constraints & Technical Feasibility

## What are common technical constraints that impact UX design?

- Device/browser limitations (e.g., mobile responsiveness)

- Load times and performance issues

- Platform-specific guidelines (iOS vs. Android)

- Backend limitations or legacy systems

- Frontend framework capabilities

- API limitations or data availability

## How do UX designers collaborate with developers to find workable solutions?

- Include developers early in the design process

- Ask about technical constraints before finalizing complex features

- Use annotated wireframes to clarify interactions

- Run design-development handoff sessions

- Iterate together: propose design alternatives when needed

## What are best practices for simplifying complex designs without losing functionality?

- Focus on core tasksâ€”remove or deprioritize edge-case features

- Break flows into smaller, progressive steps

- Use progressive disclosure (hide complexity until needed)

- Prioritize usability over visual detail

- Reuse established patterns and components

## How can designers advocate for usability and accessibility, even when technical limitations exist?

- Share real user pain points backed by testing or data

- Propose phased solutions (MVP now, improvements later)

- Suggest alternative approaches (e.g., semantic HTML over animations)

- Educate the team on WCAG guidelines and legal risks

- Prioritize changes that benefit the most users

## If a developer tells you a design is too complex to implement, how would you respond?

- Ask which parts are most difficult and why

- Offer to simplify or adjust the design

- Suggest collaborative brainstorming for alternatives

- Reframe the conversation around user needs and goals

- Be open to compromise while protecting the user experience

## What are some non-visual factors (e.g., performance, accessibility, load time) that can impact a UX design?

- Performance: slow load times frustrate users

- Accessibility: screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation

- Responsiveness: layout adaptability across devices

- Latency: impacts real-time interactions or feedback

- Security: limits on what data can be shown or stored

- SEO (for web apps): affects discoverability

## How can UX designers help find middle-ground solutions between ideal design and technical feasibility?

- Identify the core user goal and retain that experience

- Break large features into smaller, buildable parts

- Prioritize features based on user impact and dev effort

- Use flexible layouts and reusable components

- Document trade-offs and revisit when resources allow
