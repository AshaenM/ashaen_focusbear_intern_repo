# Working with PMs to Prioritize UX Work

## How do PMs decide which UX improvements to prioritize?

- Based on impact on KPIs (e.g., conversion, retention, NPS)

- User feedback volume and severity of issues

- Alignment with business goals or upcoming launches

- Development effort vs. value (cost-benefit)

- Competitive advantage or market expectations

## What factors influence prioritization?

- User impact and frequency of the issue

- Technical complexity and development cost

- Strategic timing (e.g., feature releases, marketing campaigns)

- Legal, accessibility, or compliance needs

- Feedback from sales, support, or customer success teams

## How can UX designers make a strong case for usability improvements?

- Use usability testing results and user quotes

- Show metrics: task completion rates, bounce/drop-off points

- Frame improvements in terms of revenue, retention, or efficiency

- Provide mockups or prototypes to communicate solutions clearly

- Reference competitor benchmarks or UX best practices

## What frameworks help balance UX work with feature development?

- RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)

- MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won’t-have)

- Kano Model (Basic needs, performance needs, delighters)

- Design debt tracking (logging recurring usability pain points)

- Agile UX sprints with UX tasks embedded in product backlog

## If a PM tells you there’s no time for a UX improvement, how would you respond?

- Ask to timebox a lightweight version or quick win

- Clarify the user/business risk of delaying it

- Offer data to show the trade-off in user friction or churn

- Suggest deferring it to the next sprint or phase with a reminder

## How can UX designers ensure that important usability issues don’t get ignored?

- Document and prioritize them in a shared backlog

- Tag issues with user impact level (e.g., blockers, friction, confusion)

- Share clips or quotes from user sessions

- Regularly surface issues during planning or sprint reviews

- Build advocacy with PMs and devs through collaboration

## What’s the best way to present UX work as a business priority rather than a "nice-to-have"?

- Translate design work into business outcomes (e.g., improved conversion, lower support costs)

- Show how good UX reduces churn or increases user engagement

- Tie usability fixes to metrics stakeholders care about

- Include real-user stories or pain points from support tickets

- Quantify the cost of inaction (e.g., time wasted, user loss)
