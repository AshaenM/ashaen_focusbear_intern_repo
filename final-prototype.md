# Testing & Iterating on Prototypes

## What are best practices for testing high-fidelity prototypes?

- Test with realistic tasks and flows.

- Include both happy paths and edge cases.

- Observe silently and take notes on behavior, not just opinions.

- Use tools like Figma, Maze, or Useberry to track clicks and paths.

- Record sessions (with consent) to review later.

- Include diverse user types to uncover broader issues.

## How do you analyze feedback from stakeholders vs. end-users?

- Stakeholders: Focus on business goals, branding, technical feasibility.

- End-users: Focus on usability, clarity, and satisfaction.

- Identify overlaps and tensions, then prioritize based on user impact.

## What techniques help designers prioritize feedback and avoid overdesigning?

- Group feedback into themes (e.g., usability, aesthetics, flow).

- Use effort-impact matrices to assess changes.

- Stick to core user goals—don’t add features unless they solve real problems.

- Run small, fast tests before making big changes.

## How should usability testing findings influence prototype iterations?

- Prioritize changes that fix task-blocking issues first.

- Adjust layouts, wording, or flows that caused confusion.

- Don’t just fix surface-level complaints—look for root causes.

- Document what changed and retest if needed.

## How can UX designers balance design vision vs. user feedback when making iterations?

- Keep the core design principles intact, adapt the execution.

- Use feedback to refine—not override—the vision.

- Make evidence-based decisions (data + user needs).

- Align updates with long-term product goals.

## If conflicting feedback arises, how would you decide what to change?

- Identify which feedback aligns with user goals and usability.

- Prioritize feedback from actual users over internal opinions.

- Test variations (A/B testing or preference tests) to validate.

- Consider business impact and technical feasibility.

## What are the risks of iterating too much without clear direction?

- Design becomes inconsistent or overly complex.

- Wasted time on low-impact changes.

- Team confusion or decision fatigue.

- Loss of focus on the core user problem.


## Task

Since I am in my final week of the internship, I am unable to complete the high-fi prototype. Hence, I will answer the rest of the questions in a hypothetical manner.

### Prototype Testing and Feedback

**Test Participant:**  
A colleague from the design team (UX Designer)

**Testing Method:**  
Moderated usability test — observed the participant navigating through the high-fidelity prototype of the settings page in Figma.  
The session lasted approximately 20 minutes and focused on core user flows such as setting up habits, editing preferences, and managing notifications.

### Usability Issues Identified

1. **Navigation Clarity**  
   The participant mentioned that it wasn’t immediately clear how to return to the main dashboard after adjusting settings.  
   **Suggestion:** Add a persistent “Back to Dashboard” button or clearer breadcrumb navigation.

2. **Visual Hierarchy**  
   Some buttons (e.g., *Edit Habits* and *Stats*) looked too similar, making it harder to tell which was currently active.  
   **Suggestion:** Use accent colors or subtle shadows to indicate selection.

3. **Overloaded Settings Page**  
   The participant noted that the settings menu still felt slightly overwhelming, even after grouping.  
   **Suggestion:** Collapse less-frequently used sections (like *Permissions* and *Theme*) under an “Advanced Settings” dropdown.

4. **Friction Feature Confusion**  
   The “Friction” label wasn’t immediately understood.  
   **Suggestion:** Rename it to “Focus Controls” or add a tooltip explaining its function.


### Improvements Implemented

- Added a **persistent navigation header** with a back icon to improve flow consistency.  
- Refined the **active-state color** for menu options for clearer visual feedback.  
- Grouped advanced or infrequently accessed settings under a **collapsible section**.  
- Updated the **Friction** section label to **Focus Controls** with a short description tooltip.  
- Adjusted spacing and alignment for better visual balance across screens.

### Iteration and Resubmission

After applying the feedback, the revised prototype was **retested informally** with the same participant, who confirmed that the navigation and visual hierarchy felt more intuitive.  
The updated version has now been submitted for final design critique in Figma for supervisor review and has been approved.
