## Introduction

Hi! Thank you for participating in this usability test.  
We're testing the design and functionality of our app, **Focus Bear**, to understand how we can improve the user experience.  

**Please note:** We're testing the app — *not* you. There are no right or wrong answers, and you're not being evaluated.  
Feel free to think aloud as you go through the tasks, and share any thoughts, questions, or frustrations that come up.

Explore whatever options seem helpful to get you started.
