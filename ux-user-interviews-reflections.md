# How to Conduct User Interviews & Usability Testing

## What are best practices for conducting user interviews?
- Prepare clear, open-ended questions aligned with research goals
- Build rapport to make participants comfortable
- Listen actively and avoid leading questions
- Record sessions (with permission) for accuracy
- Take notes on key insights and observations
- Encourage participants to share stories and examples
- Keep interviews focused but flexible to explore unexpected topics
- Thank participants and respect their time

## How do you run an effective usability test without influencing the user?
- Use neutral language, avoid leading or suggestive questions
- Let users explore tasks naturally without interrupting
- Encourage users to think aloud to understand their thought process
- Observe quietly and take notes without guiding them
- Ask open-ended questions after tasks, not during
- Avoid showing reactions that might bias their behavior
- Prepare tasks that reflect real user goals
- Keep the environment comfortable and distraction-free

## What types of questions should UX designers ask during interviews?
- Open-ended questions: Encourage detailed answers (e.g., “Can you tell me about...?”)
- Experience-focused: Ask about past behaviors and challenges (e.g., “How do you usually...?”)
- Motivation-based: Understand why users do things (e.g., “What motivates you to...?”)
- Pain points: Identify frustrations or obstacles (e.g., “What do you find difficult about...?”)
- Preference questions: Discover likes and dislikes (e.g., “What do you prefer in a tool like this?”)
- Clarification questions: Dig deeper when needed (e.g., “Can you explain more about that?”)
- Avoid leading or yes/no questions to get richer insights

## How can recording and note-taking improve research accuracy?
- Captures exact user words and tone for better analysis
-Ensures no important details are missed during the session
- Allows researchers to review and verify findings later
- Helps in sharing insights with the team accurately
- Supports identifying patterns across multiple sessions
- Frees interviewer to focus on active listening rather than writing nonstop


## What are common mistakes to avoid when conducting user research?
- Asking leading or biased questions
- Interrupting users or influencing their responses
- Focusing too much on your assumptions, not users’ real experiences
- Not recruiting diverse participants
- Ignoring or missing non-verbal cues
- Failing to record or take thorough notes
- Overgeneralizing from too small or unrepresentative samples
- Skipping preparation or clear research goals

## If a user struggles with a feature during testing, how do you know if it’s a UX problem or a learning curve issue?
- Observe if the struggle happens consistently across multiple users, then it would likely be a UX problem
- Check if users can complete the task after brief guidance which would suggest its a learning curve
- Note if instructions or labels are unclear which points to UX issues
- Ask users about their expectations and confusion during or after the task
- Review if the feature matches common usability heuristics (e.g., feedback, visibility)
- Use follow-up testing to see if improvements reduce the struggle

## How can UX designers ensure they don’t influence user responses during an interview?
- Use neutral, open-ended questions without leading words
- Avoid expressing approval or disapproval during answers
- Maintain a calm, non-judgmental tone
- Let users speak without interruptions
- Refrain from suggesting answers or options
- Use silence strategically to encourage more detail
- Prepare and follow a structured interview guide to stay objective

## What’s the best way to document usability testing results so they are useful for design decisions?
- Summarize key findings and insights upfront
- Organize results by task or feature tested
- Include user quotes and observations for context
- Highlight successes and pain points clearly
- Prioritize issues by severity and impact
- Provide actionable recommendations linked to problems
- Use visuals like screenshots or heatmaps when possible
- Share in a collaborative format (Google Docs, Notion) for team access
