# How UX Contributes to Focus Bear’s Mission

## How does good UX design improve productivity for neurodivergent users?
- Reduces cognitive overload with clear, simple interfaces
- Supports focus through minimal distractions and structured flows
- Enhances motivation with progress tracking and positive reinforcement
- Increases confidence by making tasks feel achievable
- Respects sensory needs with calm visuals and low-stimulation design

## What are common UX pain points for people with ADHD & Autism?
- Cluttered interfaces
- Complex language
- Bright colours
- Too many notifications
- Hidden features
- Unclear navigation

## What makes an interface overwhelming vs. intuitive for neurodivergent users?
Overwhelming Interface:
- Too much information shown at once
- Inconsistent layouts or navigation patterns
- Distracting animations, sounds, or colors
- Complex wording or jargon
- No clear focus or visual hierarchy

Intuitive Interface:
- Clean, uncluttered design with focused tasks
- Predictable navigation and consistent interactions
- Clear labels and plain language
- Minimal animations, calm visuals
- Obvious next steps and helpful guidance

## How can clear navigation, minimal distractions, and predictable UI patterns improve user experience?
- Clear navigation helps users know where they are and where to go next
- Minimal distractions allow users to stay focused on their tasks
- Predictable UI patterns build trust and reduce anxiety
- All together, they lower cognitive load and make the app easier to use, especially for neurodivergent users. They also boost task completion and confidence by making actions feel intuitive and manageable

## If a new feature looks visually appealing but is hard to use, how should UX designers handle that tradeoff?
- Prioritize usability as function must support the user’s goals
- Gather user feedback through testing to confirm issues
- Collaborate with UI designers to find a balanced solution
- Simplify the interaction or offer progressive disclosure
- Document pros/cons and communicate impact clearly to the team

## What specific challenges might neurodivergent users face when using productivity apps?
- Difficulty starting tasks due to executive dysfunction
- Overwhelm from cluttered interfaces or too many features
- Struggles with maintaining focus if distractions aren’t minimized
- Sensory overload from loud colors, flashing animations, or sounds
- Unclear feedback or next steps, causing confusion
