# How to Give and Receive Design Critique

## What is design critique, and why is it a crucial part of the UX process?
Design critique is a structured feedback session where designers review and discuss each other’s work to improve usability, clarity, and alignment with goals.

Why it’s crucial:
- Improves designs through diverse perspectives
- Identifies usability issues early
- Ensures alignment with user needs and product goals
- Strengthens team collaboration and shared understanding
- Encourages growth through constructive, actionable feedback

## What are the key principles of giving helpful, constructive feedback?
- Be specific – Focus on clear examples, not vague opinions
- Be objective – Critique the work, not the person
- Use "I" statements – Share your perspective without blaming
- Balance positives and suggestions – Highlight what works too
- Tie feedback to goals – Relate it to user needs or design principles
- Ask questions – Encourage discussion and reflection
- Be respectful and kind – Maintain a supportive tone

## How should designers receive and apply critique without taking it personally?
- Stay open-minded – View critique as a tool for improvement
- Listen fully – Don’t interrupt or get defensive
- Ask clarifying questions – Ensure you understand the feedback
- Focus on the design’s goals, not personal attachment
- Separate identity from work – It’s about the design, not you
- Reflect before reacting – Take time to consider the input
-Apply feedback selectively – Use what aligns with user needs and project goals

## What are common mistakes when giving or receiving design feedback?
- Giving vague or overly general feedback
- Focusing on personal opinions instead of user needs
- Criticizing the person, not the work
- Ignoring positive aspects and only pointing out negatives
- Reacting defensively or emotionally when receiving feedback
- Failing to ask questions or seek clarification
- Providing feedback too late in the process when changes are harder

## What is the difference between personal opinion and objective UX critique?
- Personal opinion: Based on individual preferences or tastes, often subjective and not backed by user data.
- Objective UX critique: Grounded in user research, usability principles, and measurable outcomes focused on improving user experience.

## If someone gives vague feedback like "I don’t like this", how would you get more useful input?
- Ask specific questions: “Can you tell me what part you don’t like?”, “What feels confusing or frustrating?”
- Request examples or comparisons: “Is there a design you prefer instead?”
- Encourage focus on user impact: “How do you think this affects the user’s experience?”
- Offer to walk through the design together to spot issues
- Use open-ended prompts: “What would make this better for you?”

## How can you ensure that design critique sessions are productive rather than overwhelming?
- Set clear goals and focus areas before the session
- Limit the number of designs or topics reviewed per meeting
- Encourage respectful, constructive feedback only
- Use a structured format (e.g., “What works,” “What doesn’t,” “Suggestions”)
- Keep sessions time-boxed to avoid fatigue
- Foster a safe, supportive environment where everyone feels heard
- Follow up with actionable next steps after the session
