## Identify one design or communication improvement that could make Focus Bear more accessible
As I was going through the Focus Bear website. I came across a short section on Jeremy's Founder's note.

I then clicked the the "Read mroe about Jeremy's story..." link. It took me to this page
![Page that loads when clicking that link](image-1.png)

This confused me at first because I thought this was an incorrect link. A small note that the "Share" text is not a link which can be confusing. But as I scrolled down and read through the text, I realised it was what I wanted to read about and how the saucepans were relevant to this link.

To avoid confusion, maybe include a title at the new page that shows that I was taken to the expected page and maybe not include the whole section of the initial part of the page to include the saucepan image and text.
