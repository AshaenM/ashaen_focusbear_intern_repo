# Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) for Desk-Based Work

## What are the main Agile ceremonies, and what is their purpose?
- Daily Stand-ups
  - Each team member shares what they did the previous day, what they'll do today and any blockers. 
  - This improves team alignment and stay on track.
- Sprint Planning (Scrum)
  - At the start of a sprint, the team decides what work to commit to. 
  - This sets a clear goal and target with a shared understanding.
- Continous Prioritization (Kanban)
  - Ongoing, flexible prioritization of tasks as new work comes in.
  - This ensures the team always works on the more important task  without fixed sprint cycles.
- Retrospectives
  - End-of-sprint or regular reflection on what went well, what didn’t, and how to improve.
  - This ontinuously improves team processes, communication, and collaboration.
- Backlog Refinement
  - Regularly review and update the backlog by clarifying tasks, re-prioritizing, and breaking down large stories.
  - This keeps the backlog organised and ready for upcoming work, reducing confusion during planning.

## How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?
- Using clear, written communication on tools such as Slack, Notion, and Confluence.
- Shared task boards.
- Recorded updates.

## How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?
- Daily stand ups help everyone communicate their work and progress which helps everyone be on the same page.
- Sprint planning or prioritization helps align the team on goals and priorities before starting work, reducing misunderstandings.
- Retrospectives create a safe space to reflect, give feedback, and improve team collaboration.
- Backlog refinement helps keep all the task organised based on priority so the team always knows what’s next.


## Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?
As a UX Designer, I think the sprint planning ceremony is the most important.
- It will let me align early with the team on priorities and goals, ensuring my design work fits the sprint’s focus.
- It provides a chance to advocate for user research or design tasks needed in the sprint.
- Early involvement helps avoid last-minute changes and rework, making my workflow smoother and more predictable.

## Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration.
I can schedule brief, regular design check-ins with developers and product managers during the sprint. This ensures ongoing alignment, quick feedback, and helps catch issues early—reducing misunderstandings and improving workflow.
