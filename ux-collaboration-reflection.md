# How UX Works with Other Teams

## How do UX designers work with developers to ensure accurate implementation?
- Share design files
- Provide the design specifications
- Use components consistently in the design system
- Document edge cases and behaviour
- Hold handoff meetings to walk through the design

## How does UX contribute to product decisions and roadmap planning?
- User research insights
- Usability testing results
- Data driven design
- Prototypes
- Accessibility considerations

## What role does UX play in QA and usability testing?
- Designs test scenarios based on user goals and flows
- Creates usability tasks to evaluate clarity and ease of use
- Observes user behavior to identify pain points and confusion
- Collaborates with QA to ensure visual and interaction accuracy
- Logs UX bugs like misaligned elements or unclear microcopy
- Refines designs based on feedback and test results

## How should designers provide clear documentation and feedback to other teams?
- Use annotated figma files
- Create design specifications
- Write clear, concise notes
- Use visual examples
- Document in shared tools
- Provide async video walkthroughs
- Organise feedback logically

## How can UX ensure a smooth handoff between design and development?
- Prepare detailed design specs with measurements, colors, and states
- Use shared design systems and components for consistency
- Hold handoff meetings to explain designs and answer questions
- Provide interactive prototypes to demonstrate flows and interactions
- Keep communication open for clarifications during development
- Review early builds to catch deviations or issues
- Document edge cases and exceptions clearly

## What challenges might arise when design, dev, and product teams have conflicting priorities?
- Misaligned goals causing delays or scope creep
- Communication breakdowns leading to misunderstandings
- Frustration or low morale among team members
- Compromised product quality due to rushed decisions
- I personally experienced similar issues last semester in my capstone project in uni. We had two UX designers and two developers. One of the designers used high resolution, full-width images that look really nice on all screen sizes. The mockups looked beautiful in Figma too. But the developers focused on performance and wanted the app to load fast so we concluded by agreeing that prioritising performance over the appearance.

## If a developer modifies a UX design due to technical limitations, how should a UX designer respond?
- Stay open-minded and understand the technical constraints
- Collaborate to find alternative solutions that preserve user experience
- Evaluate the impact of changes on usability and accessibility
- Communicate any concerns or risks clearly and constructively
- Update designs and documentation to reflect agreed changes
- Test the modified design to ensure it still meets user needs
- Maintain a positive, problem-solving attitude to support teamwork
